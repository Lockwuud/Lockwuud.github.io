I'm a second year undergraduate student from [School of CSE](https://www.scse.uestc.edu.cn/), [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/). My research interests include SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), computer vision, and deep learning. Currently, my primary focus is on SLAM, aiming to provide fast, accurate, and robust localization for robots through laser SLAM algorithms.
