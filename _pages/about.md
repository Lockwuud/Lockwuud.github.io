I'm a second year undergraduate student from [School of CSE](https://www.scse.uestc.edu.cn/), [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/). I am a member of the LIMITI Robotics Team at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, currently serving as the Visual Group Leader and preparing for the 2025 Robocon competition. My research interests include SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), computer vision, and deep learning. Currently, my primary focus is on SLAM, aiming to provide fast, accurate, and robust localization for robots through laser SLAM algorithms.
